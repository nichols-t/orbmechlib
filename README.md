# orbmechlib
A library of Python functions useful in computing and visualizing orbits.

This project is intended to be a Python module which contains tools for calculating orbital trajectories, energies, and other data.

The project can currently graph an elliptical orbit in two dimensions, and it can compute the apside radii and velocities, as well as the orbital period.
